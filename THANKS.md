# Special Thanks
In this file I will thanks people without whom this project would not be possible :


- [Tom Kerrigan](http://www.tckerrigan.com) for his wonderfull educational engine TSCP (if your chess engine has a bug, go to read TSCP and the bug will no longer exist !)
- DynaSchool, who learned me to code, who showed to me his support in this project, who encouraged my scientific curiosity, and also who plays chess with me
- [chessprogramming.org](http://www.chessprogramming.org), the best website about chessprogramming

- Th√©odora, a great friend who encouraged me during this project and let me use her cat's name
